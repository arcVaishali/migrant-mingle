## About Migrant Mingle
> A digital gathering place where first-generation low-income immigrant students can mingle, exchange family recipes, get in touch with others, and update their statuses to maintain a sense of security in order to thrive in their new study environments.

## Inspiration
> When we started this project, we realized the challenges faced by these students can sometimes be overwhelming. They often feel isolated, lacking the supportive network that their peers might have. That's where Migrate Mingle comes in.

Migrate Mingle is a user-friendly online platform designed to connect these students with each other and provide them with the support they need to succeed academically and socially. Additionally, it offers firsthand perspectives on unfamiliar locales and cultures, graciously contributed by those who have already undergone such experiences.


## What it does
