# Migrant Mingle- Cultivating Connections, Celebrating Voices.
> A digital gathering place where first-generation low-income immigrant students can mingle, exchange family recipes, get in touch with others, and update their statuses to maintain a sense of security in order to thrive in their new study environments.

## Inspiration
> When we started this project, we realized the challenges faced by these students can sometimes be overwhelming. They often feel isolated, lacking the supportive network that their peers might have. That's where Migrate Mingle comes in.

Migrate Mingle is a user-friendly online platform designed to connect these students with each other and provide them with the support they need to succeed academically and socially. Additionally, it offers firsthand perspectives on unfamiliar locales and cultures, graciously contributed by those who have already undergone such experiences.

## How we built it
Leveraging an arsenal of cutting-edge tools, we meticulously orchestrated the construction of this visionary digital realm. At the core of our architectural masterpiece lay the triumvirate of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, synergizing to craft an immersive user interface. Harnessing the dynamic capabilities of Next.js, we forged a robust foundation, seamlessly integrating its server-side rendering prowess. Tailwind CSS emerged as our design opus, elegantly sculpting the visual narrative through its utility-driven approach. As the intricate threads of functionality intertwined, Firestore and Firebase orchestrated a symphony of data storage and real-time interactions, underpinned by OAuth for secure authentication. Our development cadence was choreographed with the precision of Git and GitHub, bestowing version control mastery. The crescendo of our endeavor resonated with the unveiling on Vercel, a seamless culmination of deployment artistry. Thus, through the orchestration of this technological ballet, we wove a narrative where innovation converges with design excellence. Besides we built Migrant Mingle with love and consideration for the first generation low income students and their struggles. Here is the summary of tools we used-

## Challenges we ran into
We had trouble connecting and being on the same page during the entire hackathon because our team members were from different time zones but we solved this problem very soon by dividing tasks effectively. Also for most of our members few of the tools mentioned above were new to them due which it took a lot of time to build the initial barebone of our project and in bringing all of the team members on the same page. In addition to this we also had trouble implementing OAuth in our project and also in creating an effective design template and theme to work upon. But in the end, we did surely come up with the purple theme, which represents inclusivity and diversity due to its combination of the warm color, Red and the cool color, Blue, representing the coming together of different elements.

## Accomplishments that we are proud of
One of our major achievements is that we were able to effectively plan, work strategically in such a less time and present you all with our basic barebone of this idea- Migrant Mingle, despite being time zones apart with one another; we were able to effectively deliver the MVP of our idea. In addition to this we are proud of making something useful and impactful for our society. Moreover many of our new and novice team members acquired experience with working new technologies like Next.js, Tailwind, Firebase and OAuth to which they were widely unfamiliar. We had such a great time connecting with such amazing people from the Empower Hacks team and with their Discord community, with whom we had great time connecting and attending live hack sessions by Empower Hack team with. Moreover we got the opportunity to learn from more experienced team members in our team and in the Empower Hacks Discord Server.

## What we learned
Embarking on the journey to build this transformative platform has been an enlightening experience, replete with invaluable lessons. As we delved into the intricate interplay of technology and human connection, we learned that every line of code carries the potential to resonate deeply with users' lives. The significance of user-centered design became palpable as we observed the impact of seamless navigation and personalized experiences on engagement. Collaboratively developing and refining features taught us the power of teamwork, where diverse perspectives converged to create a unified vision. The fusion of creativity and technical prowess enabled us to bridge the digital divide, cultivating an ecosystem where stories are nurtured, cultures celebrated, and connections fostered. As we move forward, we carry with us the knowledge that the harmonious blend of innovation, empathy, and dedication has the capacity to shape a digital landscape that mirrors the vibrant tapestry of human experiences. We learnt team work, collaborating with other people and using community forums and reading documentations in a proper way. In addition to this many of our new and novice team members acquired experience with working new technologies like Next.js, Tailwind, Firebase and OAuth. We had an amazing time coding and collaborating this weekend, thank you Empower Hacks team for giving us this opportunity to learn more about problems faced by first gen low income students and giving us an incredible weekend.
